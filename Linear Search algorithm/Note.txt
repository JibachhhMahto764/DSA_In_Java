What is Searching?
=> It's technique that helps us search a data element out at the given string or array.

linear search:

arr[18,24,9,14,77,50] unsorted array
 size=6

Q. Find Whether 14 exits in array or not?
 arr[3]=14


At the best time complexity Is = 0(1)// constant 
At the Worst case = 0(N)
            where N is size of array

target = 18 answer => only 1 comparison make in Best case 
 it the best case size is not matter

Worst => you don't find the target item.
iterate go through every item and then in the end it says i did not find it.


if size of array = 100 => 100<comparison
  if array = N => N<comparison 
         0(N) => Worst case
